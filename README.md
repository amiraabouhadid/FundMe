# ETHEREUM WEB APP: FUND ME
A web application that runs on the ethereum blockchain where users can safely create and contribute to funding campaigns without worrying about the campaign manager taking the money and getting nothing in return. All contracts and transactions are open source, so contributors can check on their investment at any time and from anywhere. All spending requests must be approved by more than 50% of the contributors to be released to the vendor.
